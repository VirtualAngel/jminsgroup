            <p>JM Insurance Group specializes in writing home, renters, landlord, auto, umbrella, motorcycles, ATV's boats or any other toys or unique items you may own. We have several types of personal insurance to cover all of your individual circumstances.</p>

            <p>We are an independent agency that offers a full range of insurance products from several A rated or better companies. This means you don't have to change agencies as your insurance situations evolve.</p>

            <p>Understanding insurance can be quite complicated and at JM Insurance Group we believe in explaining the options to you so you can make an educated decision on the route you would like to pursue. We encourage a face to face visit for the initial meeting to explain coverage and address any gaps in insurance you may have. We will do a periodic review every couple years since life happens and things change.</p>

            <p>The companies we represent are great at handling claims. However, the claims experience can be confusing and we are here to help guide you throughout the process.</p>

            <p>We are committed to great customer satisfaction! Stop by and visit, call us, or <a href="#request">request a quote</a> today!</p>
