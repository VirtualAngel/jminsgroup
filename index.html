                <h3>Joni</h3>
                <p>As of December 2021, Joni has retired. Although we are sad to see her leave us, we are delighted to inform you that she will be helping us out with clerical duties periodically throughout the summer! </p>
                <p>Joni grew up in our neighboring state in Powell, Wyoming. In 1986, she earned a Bachelor's degree in marketing from Portland State University. Her enthusiasm for marketing stemmed from her time at Levi Strauss in the late 1970s. As part of their sales team, Joni worked exclusively with account executives, where she sold large quantities of men's clothing to major companies such as Macy's. While at Levi Strauss, she was considered an "idea person," often brainstorming with the advertising department for national sales campaigns.</p>
                <p>Joni joins JM Insurance Group as a Personal Lines Producer, specializing in home, auto, and recreation vehicles. She is your personal shopper for your insurance needs! </p>
                <p>In the 1980s, Joni became the Director of Marketing for a national interactive video educational program. There, she designed school catalogs and wrote press releases. This experience included planning a National Conference for schools all over the United States whose goal was to engage students in interactive video classes. This company was ahead of its time, a stepping stone to online college classes.</p>
                <p>During the mid-90s, Joni managed multifamily properties in Portland. While there, she worked for a builder and aided in renting new apartments by finding acceptable tenants. In addition, Joni trained other managers to be successful in rental retention using strong screening criteria.</p>
                <p>For the past fifteen years, Joni switched gears, working in the medical field as a respiratory therapist. But, it was time to get back to her business roots. After purchasing her house three years ago, she was impressed with a homeowner's policy experience, which led to her new interest: insurance. </p>
